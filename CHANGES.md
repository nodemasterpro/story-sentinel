# Story Sentinel v1.2 - Native Installation

## Summary of Changes

Story Sentinel has been completely refactored to provide a **native installation** experience with full upgrade automation capabilities. All Docker dependencies and limitations have been removed.

## ✅ What Was Accomplished

### 🔄 Complete Docker Removal
- ❌ Removed `Dockerfile`, `docker-compose.yml`, `.dockerignore`
- ❌ Removed all Docker-specific configuration files (`.env.docker`)
- ❌ Removed Docker mode detection and limitations from code
- ❌ Removed Docker-specific networking and RPC endpoint handling

### 🏗️ Native Installation System
- ✅ **Complete auto-detection installer** (`install.sh`)
- ✅ **Quick start wizard** (`quick-start.sh`) with configuration assistant
- ✅ **Systemd service** with proper integration
- ✅ **Upgrade management script** (`scripts/upgrade-runner.sh`)
- ✅ **Installation testing suite** (`test-installation.sh`)

### ⚙️ Configuration Management
- ✅ **Environment variable priority**: All services and binary paths configurable
- ✅ **Auto-detection**: Automatically finds Story binaries, services, and ports
- ✅ **Flexible configuration**: Support for all installation types (standard, NodeMaster, custom)
- ✅ **Complete variable set**:
  - `STORY_BINARY_PATH` - Story binary location
  - `STORY_SERVICE_NAME` - Story systemd service name
  - `STORY_RPC_PORT` - Story RPC port
  - `STORY_GETH_BINARY_PATH` - Story-Geth binary location
  - `STORY_GETH_SERVICE_NAME` - Story-Geth systemd service name
  - `STORY_GETH_RPC_PORT` - Story-Geth RPC port

### 🔄 Upgrade Capabilities
- ✅ **Full systemd integration**: Can start/stop/restart services
- ✅ **Automatic backups**: Before every upgrade
- ✅ **Rollback functionality**: Automatic rollback on failure
- ✅ **Binary replacement**: Safe binary updating process
- ✅ **Pre/post checks**: Comprehensive verification

### 📚 Documentation
- ✅ **English README**: Complete documentation in English
- ✅ **Clear installation guide**: Step-by-step instructions
- ✅ **Configuration examples**: Real-world configuration samples
- ✅ **Troubleshooting section**: Common issues and solutions
